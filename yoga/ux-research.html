        My initial responsibility at D4Next was to deeply understand our user's
        behaviors, needs, problems, and desires. This task was challenging, as
        the company initially prioritized development over thorough research and
        analysis. To achieve this understanding, I employed several research
        methods:

          <div>
            <strong>Field Studies:</strong> Observing intermediaries and
            customers at the company office to gather real-world insights into
            their interactions and challenges.

            <strong>Requirements Gathering:</strong> Understanding the company's

              <div>
                Intermediaries face significant challenges due to <strong>time-consuming tasks</strong> and <strong>outdated technology</strong>. They need better tools to streamline workflows and improve efficiency. While they prefer in-person and phone communication, they seek enhanced digital solutions for client interactions.

            <div class="user-section-icon customer" style="margin: 0;"></div>
              <div>
                Customers face challenges with <strong>complex insurance terms</strong> and <strong>lack of transparency</strong>. They prioritize cost, coverage, and provider reputation when choosing policies. They prefer online and in-person interactions but seek more <strong>user-friendly digital tools for easier policy management</strong>. Customers expressed frustration with poor customer service and desire more clear and accessible information throughout the purchasing process.
